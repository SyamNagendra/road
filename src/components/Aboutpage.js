        At Pothole Uncovered, we aim to bridge the gap between citizens, local
        authorities, and technology by creating a user-friendly platform to
        report, manage, and resolve road-related issues efficiently. We believe
        that better roads lead to better communities. By empowering users and
        promoting collaboration, weâ€™re helping build safer streets for drivers,
        cyclists, and pedestrians alike.
